						<h3>1. Inventory Management System (Android mobile application)</h3>
						<p>The Inventory Management System is a mobile based application designed on Android platform. The main aim of the project is to develop Inventory Management mobile 
							application in which all the information regarding the stock of the organization will be presented. 
							It is an internet based mobile application which has admin component to manage the inventory. 
							This mobile application is based on the management of stock of a restaurant. The application is made of 2 sections.
							 Access to each section is managed by login. First being the client side where the restaurant can order goods, 
							 view the list  of pending ordered goods and a list of received/delivered goods. Second is the admin side which can manage
							  (CURD operations) inventory items, send special notification, view and manage received orders, view and manage delivered
							   orders and has an automatic invoice generation and sending according to registered email. There is a provision of updating
								the inventory also. This application also provides the remaining balance of the stock as well as the details of the transaction.
								 Each new stock is created and entitled with the name and the entry date of that stock and it can also be updated any time when 
								 required as per the transaction or the sales is returned in case. Here the login page is created in order to protect the management 
								 of the stock of organization in order to prevent it from the threads and misuse of the inventory.

						<h3>2. Stream Analytics of Trending Movies using Microsoft Azure</h3>
						<p>Analysis of online user produced content is receiving attention for its wide applications from both academic
							researchers and industry. In our work, we address common Big Data problems of time restrictions and memory
							outlays involved with using standard system. A new big data analytics framework is proposed to find a subset
							of user-created popular culture content on Indian movies, well-known language online contents. Large number
							of data samples is produce via web logs. We also discuss how to manipulate heterogeneous features from raw
							samples to facilitate analysis of various film details, review comments, and user profiles on Indian with explicit
							consider to a wave of South Indian films, which have increased in popularity among Indian film supporters. In
							addition, an association rule mining algorithms based on Maximum Entropy classifier is proposed for content
							mining retrieval. The results shows the flexibility and productivity of the proposed framework for mining
							relevant information from complex online web information, knowledge which can in twirl be expanded beyond
							this and used to give relevant, useful information to film makers and distributors.

						<h3>3. Remote Controlled Drone</h3>
						<p>The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has grown
							because of their ability to operate in dangerous locations while
							keeping their human operators at a safe distance. The larger UAVs
							also provide a reliable long duration, cost effective, platform for
							reconnaissance as well as weapons. They have grown to become an
							indispensable tool for the military. The question we posed for our
							project was whether small UAVs also had utility in military and
							commercial/industrial applications. We postulated that smaller UAVs
							can serve more tactical operations such as searching a village or a
							building for enemy positions. Smaller UAVs, on the order of a couple
							feet to a meter in size, should be able to handle military tactical
							operations as well as the emerging commercial and industrial
							applications and our project is attempting to validate this assumption.
