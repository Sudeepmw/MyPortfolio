							<p>To validate this assumption, my team considered many different UAV
                                designs before we settled on creating a Quadcopter. The payload of
                                our Quadcopter design includes a camera and telemetry that will allow
                                us to watch live video from the Quadcopter on a laptop that is located
                                up to 200metres. We have stared the project in terms of getting a grade
                                for my senior design but we will continue to work on the Quadcopter
                                to improve performance and controllability and Range of Live feed.</p>

								The internet of things (IoT), is the internetworking of physical devices, vehicles (also
referred to as &quot;connected devices&quot; and &quot;smart devices&quot;), buildings and other
itemsâ€”embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network
connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. In 2013 the Global
Standards Initiative on Internet of Things (IoT-GSI) defined the IoT as &quot;the
infrastructure of the information society.&quot; The IoT allows objects to be sensed and/or
controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for
more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and
resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit. When IoT is
augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an instance of the
more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies
such as smart grids, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities. Each
thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to
interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure.

                                <p>The proposal here is to build a Bluetooth controlled drone using multiway firmware
                                    where you can code the flight pattern and the movements of the drone in every
                                    manner you wish to. This would in turn make it less expensive and the aerodynamic
                                    structure of the drone is built using 3-layer silicon coated fiber boards that makes it
                                    light weight and much more endurable. The motors and the propellers used in the
                                    construction are 11650kv motors and aero matrix propellers that give the drone high
                                    performance speed and stability.
                                    The main fact to be considered here is the size of the drone the drone is being built
                                    in a very miniature way as to glide through all kinds of passages and is mounted with
                                    a FPV Camera as to help guide in visual and geo-mapping.</p>
